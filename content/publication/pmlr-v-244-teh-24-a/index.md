abstract: By relaxing conditions for “natural” structure learning algorithms, a family
  of constraint-based algorithms containing all exact structure learning algorithms
  under the faithfulness assumption, we define localised natural structure learning
  algorithms (LoNS). We also provide a set of necessary and sufficient assumptions
  for consistency of LoNS, which can be thought of as a strict relaxation of the restricted
  faithfulness assumption. We provide a practical LoNS algorithm that runs in exponential
  time, which is then compared with related existing structure learning algorithms,
  namely PC/SGS and the relatively recent Sparsest Permutation algorithm. Simulation
  studies are also provided.
